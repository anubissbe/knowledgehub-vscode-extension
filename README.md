## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- VS Code 1.80.0 or later
- KnowledgeHub server running (see [setup guide](../knowledgehub/README.md))

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd knowledgehub-vscode-extension

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Package extension (optional)
vsce package
```

### 3. Configuration
Open VS Code settings and configure:

```json
{
  "knowledgehub.server.url": "http://192.168.1.25:3000",
  "knowledgehub.ai.autoEnhance": true,
  "knowledgehub.ai.primaryProvider": "auto",
  "knowledgehub.ai.enhancementLevel": "maximum"
}
```

### 4. First Use
1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run `KnowledgeHub: Initialize AI Session`
3. Your AI tools are now enhanced! 

## üéÆ Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `KnowledgeHub: Initialize AI Session` | Start enhanced AI session |
| `KnowledgeHub: Show AI Dashboard` | Open AI insights dashboard |
| `KnowledgeHub: Analyze Project Context` | Analyze current project |
| `KnowledgeHub: Show Memory Context` | View AI memory and history |
| `KnowledgeHub: Enable AI Enhancement` | Toggle AI enhancement on/off |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Settings
```json
{
  // KnowledgeHub server URL
  "knowledgehub.server.url": "http://192.168.1.25:3000",
  
  // Automatically enhance AI requests
  "knowledgehub.ai.autoEnhance": true,
  
  // Primary AI provider to enhance
  "knowledgehub.ai.primaryProvider": "auto", // or "github_copilot", "cline", etc.
  
  // Level of context enhancement
  "knowledgehub.ai.enhancementLevel": "maximum" // "minimal", "standard", "maximum"
}
```

### Advanced Settings
```json
{
  // Track code changes for learning
  "knowledgehub.memory.trackChanges": true,
  
  // Context compression ratio for small models
  "knowledgehub.context.compressionRatio": 10,
  
  // UI preferences
  "knowledgehub.ui.hasShownWelcome": false
}
```

## üîç How It Works

### Before Enhancement:
```
You: "Create user authentication"
AI: [Generic auth code with no project context]
```

### After KnowledgeHub Enhancement:
```
You: "Create user authentication"

AI gets enhanced context:
- Your project uses JWT with 15min expiry (learned from past decisions)
- Follows existing error handling patterns
- Integrates with your existing user service
- Uses your team's preferred validation approach

AI: [Perfect code that fits your project perfectly]
```

13 MCP Services (192.168.1.24:3001-3015)
```

The extension works with the distributed KnowledgeHub infrastructure to provide intelligent AI enhancement.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Activating
```bash
# Check KnowledgeHub server connection
curl http://192.168.1.25:3000/health

# Verify VS Code version
code --version

# Check extension logs
View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí KnowledgeHub AI
```

### AI Enhancement Not Working
1. Check AI provider is installed and active
2. Verify `knowledgehub.ai.autoEnhance` is enabled
3. Initialize AI session: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí `KnowledgeHub: Initialize AI Session`

### Context Not Loading
1. Check KnowledgeHub server is running
2. Verify workspace folder is open
3. Check network connectivity to 192.168.1.25

## üìà Performance

- **Minimal Latency**: <200ms context enhancement
- **Efficient Memory**: Uses smart caching and compression
- **Scalable**: Handles large codebases with context compression
- **Reliable**: Fallback modes ensure continuous operation

## üîí Security

- **No Code Transmission**: Only metadata and context sent to KnowledgeHub
- **Local Processing**: AI enhancement happens locally when possible
- **Secure Storage**: All data encrypted and stored securely
- **Privacy-First**: No data sent to external services without consent
